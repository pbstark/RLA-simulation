    "Alice was the reported winner of the contest. \n",
    "The goal of the audit is to check whether Alice really won.\n",
    "If she did, the audit will usually stop without looking at every ballot card. \n",
    "If Alice did _not_ really win, the audit has a large chance of leading to a full hand count to determine who did win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The audit examines randomly selected ballot cards; it does not use information from the electronic voting system.\n",
    "This type of audit is called \"ballot polling.\"\n",
    "(There are RLA methods that use other information from the voting system, for instance, vote subtotals for precincts\n",
    "or the machines' record of the votes on individual ballot cards.)\n",
    "Ballot polling has similarities to an exit poll, except that instead of asking people how they voted, \n",
    "it looks at ballots to see what votes were recorded.\n",
    "Unlike a survey of voters, the ballots have to answer, and they have to answer truthfully.\n",
    "(The goal is also different: a risk-limiting audit does not try to estimate vote shares,\n",
    "only to determine who won.)\n",
    "\n",
    "RLAs can be based on sampling _with replacement_ (the same card can be selected\n",
    "more than once) or on sampling _without replacement_ (each card is selected at most once).\n",
    "The formulas for computing the risk using sampling without replacement are more complicated.\n",
    "This demo uses sampling _with_ replacement so that the calculations can be done by hand.\n",
    "If the same card is selected more than once, there is no need to _retrieve_ it more than once: \n",
    "you already know what vote it shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demo, the expected number of cards you need to inspect to confirm the outcome is about {int(expect_size)}, \n",
    "including duplicates. \n",
    "Because the sample is drawn with replacement, the audit workload depends on the candidates _shares_\n",
    "of the vote, not on the total number of votes or cards cast.\n",
    "That is, the number of draws required to confirm the outcome would be expected to be \n",
    "about {int(expect_size)} cards whether there were 100 ballot cards\n",
    "or 1,000,000 ballot cards in the election.\n",
    "The only difference is that when the election is smaller, it's more likely that the sample will contain\n",
    "the same card more than once, so the number of cards that have to be _retrieved_ is expected to be smaller.\n",
    "Of course, {int(expect_size)} is a much larger fraction of 100 than it is of 1,000,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The audit is conducted using two running totals, both of which start at zero.\n",
    "One running total summarizes the evidence that Alice got more votes than Bob. \n",
    "Bigger values are stronger evidence that Alice got more votes than Bob.\n",
    "Negative values are evidence that Bob got more votes than Alice--that the reported outcome is wrong!\n",
    "The other running total summarizes the evidence that Alice got more votes than Carol. \n",
    "Bigger values are stronger evidence that Alice got more votes than Carol.\n",

    "1. Divide the ballots into five piles according to the precinct printed at the top. \n",
    "2. Decide which of the two dice will represent the \"tens\" digit and which will represent the \"ones\" digit.\n",
    "3. Select a ballot card at random by rolling the dice to generate a two-digit random number between 00 and 99, then adding 1 to get a random number between 1 and 100 (the number of ballots).\n",
    "4. Write that number in column 2 of the worksheet.\n",
    "5. Retrieve the ballot with that serial number. The _ballot manifest_ will help you find it: it shows the range of\n",
    "serial numbers each precinct contains.\n",
    "6. Write the precinct in column 3 of the worksheet, and the position of the ballot within the precinct in column 4 of the worksheet. \n",
    "7. Retrieve a randomly selected card and read the vote from it.\n",
    "8. Write the vote in column 5 of the worksheet.\n",
    "    - if it is an undervote or overvote, don't change any running total; return to step 3.\n",
    "    - if it is a vote for Alice, add 1 to the running totals in columns 6 and 7\n",
    "    - if it is a vote for Bob, subtract {lose_rnd} from the running total for Alice v Bob (column 6) but don't change the running total for Alice v Carol (column 7)\n",
    "    - if it shows a vote for Carol, subtract {lose_rnd} from the running total for Alice v Carol (column 7), but don't change the running total in column for Alice v Bob (column 6)\n",
    "    - ignore column 8 for now\n",
    "9. Repeat steps 3--8 until either:\n",
    "    - the running totals in columns 6 and 7 hit or exceed {thresh_10_rnd} (if one of the running totals hits {thresh_10_rnd} or greater, you can stop updating it: the audit has confirmed the corresponding comparison)\n",
    "    - you get bored or discouraged and decide it's easier to do a full hand count of the votes on all the cards (which will show who really won)\n",
